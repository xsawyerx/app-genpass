=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use App::Genpass;

    my $genpass = App::Genpass->new();
    print $genpass->generate, "\n";

    $genpass = App::Genpass->new( readable => 0, length => 20 );
    print "$_\n" for $genpass->generate(10);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

If you've ever needed to create 10 (or even 10,000) passwords on the fly with
varying preferences (lowercase, uppercase, no confusing characters, special
characters, minimum length, etc.), you know it can become a pretty pesky task.

This script makes it possible to create flexible and secure passwords, quickly
and easily.

    use App::Genpass;
    my $genpass = App::Genpass->new();

    my $single_password    = $genpass->generate(1);  # returns scalar
    my @single_password    = $genpass->generate(1);  # returns array
    my @multiple_passwords = $genpass->generate(10); # returns array again
    my $multiple_passwords = $genpass->generate(10); # returns arrayref


=head1 SUBROUTINES/METHODS

=head2 new

Creates a new instance. It gets a lot of options.

=head3 flags

These are boolean flags which change the way App::Genpass works.

=over 4

=item number

You can decide how many passwords to create. The default is 1.

This can be overridden per I<generate> so you can have a default of 30 but in a
specific case only generate 2, if that's what you want.

=item readable

Use only readable characters, excluding confusing characters: "o", "O", "0",
"l", "1", "I", and special characters such as '#', '!', '%' and other symbols.

You can overwrite what characters are considered unreadable under "character
attributes" below.

Default: on.

=item verify

Verify that every type of character wanted (lowercase, uppercase, numerical,
specials, etc.) are present in the password. This makes it just a tad slower,
but it guarantees the result. Best keep it on.

To emphasize how "slower" it is: if you create 500 passwords of 500 character
length, using C<verify> off, will make it faster by 0.1 seconds.

Default: on.

=back

=head3 attributes

=over 4

=item minlength

The minimum length of password to generate.

Default: 8.

=item maxlength

The maximum length of password to generate.

Default: 10.

=item length

Use this if you want to explicitly specify the length of password to generate.

=back

=head3 character attributes

These are the attributes that control the types of characters. One can change
which lowercase characters will be used or whether they will be used at all,
for example.

    # only a,b,c,d,e,g will be consdered lowercase and no uppercase at all
    my $gp = App::Genpass->new( lowercase => [ 'a' .. 'g' ], uppercase => [] );

=over 4

=item lowercase

All lowercase characters, excluding those that are considered unreadable if the
readable flag (described above) is turned on.

Default: [ 'a' .. 'z' ] (not including excluded chars).

=item uppercase

All uppercase characters, excluding those that are considered unreadable if the
readable flag (described above) is turned on.

Default: [ 'A' .. 'Z' ] (not including excluded chars).

=item numerical

All numerical characters, excluding those that are considered unreadable if the
readable flag (described above) is turned on.

Default: [ '0' .. '9' ] (not including excluded chars).

=item unreadable

All characters which are considered (by me) unreadable. You can change this to
what you consider unreadable characters. For example:

    my $gp = App::Genpass->new( unreadable => [ qw(jlvV) ] );

After all the characters are set, unreadable characters will be removed from all
sets.

Thus, unreadable characters override all other sets. You can make unreadable
characters not count by using the C<<readable => 0>> option, described by the
I<readable> flag above.

=item specials

All special characters.

Default: [ '!', '@', '#', '$', '%', '^', '&', '*', '(', ')' ].

(not including excluded chars)

=back

=head2 generate

This method generates the password or passwords.

It accepts an optional parameter indicating how many passwords to generate.

    $gp = App::Genpass->new();
    my @passwords = $gp->generate(300); # 300 passwords to go

If you do not provide a parameter, it will use the default number of passwords
to generate, defined by the attribute B<number> explained above.

This method tries to be tricky and DWIM (or rather, DWYM). That is, if you
request it to generate only one password and use scalar context
(C<<my $p = $gp->generate(1)>>), it will return a single password.

However, if you try to generate multiple passwords and use scalar context
(C<<my $p = $gp->generate(30)>>), it will return an array reference for the
passwords.

Generating passwords with list context (C<<my @p = $gp->generate(...)>>) will
always return a list of the passwords, even if it's a single password.

=head2 get_config_from_file

Reads the configuration file using L<Config::Any>.

Shamelessly lifted from L<MooseX::SimpleConfig> because there is no
L<MouseX::SimpleConfig>.
