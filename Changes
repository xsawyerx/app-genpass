Revision history for App-Genpass

        * Create passwords in a more secure fashion (ie not simply rand())
          (Arthur Axel fREW Schmidt)

2.34    04.08.14
        * GH #3: When provided some empty types, it would loop forever.

2.33    20.11.12
        * Reinstate configuration reading which was removed with the move
          to Moo.
        * RT #81287: Update docs to reflect Mouse no longer used.
          (Props to zaxon)

2.32    01.07.12
        * RT #77652: Depend directly on MooX::Types::MooseLike.
          (nice catch, Brad Bowman!)

2.31    26.06.12
        * number was accidentally a Bool instead of Int.
          (nice catch, Jonathan Swartz! *COUGH*USETHECHI*COUGH*)

2.30    26.03.12
        - Move from Mouse to Moo - MUCH FASTER!

2.20    27.11.11
        - Add minlength and maxlength (Neil Bowers).
        - Correct warning (Neil Bowers).

2.10    08.08.11
        - Removing the need for "special" boolean flag. Using 'noreadable'
        or readable => 0 will negate special. Readable will exclude special
        characters.
        (Tim Heaney - oylenshpeegul)

2.04    06.08.11
        - Clarify the distribution contains an application as well.

        - POD fix.
        (Tim Heaney)

2.03    03.08.11
        (this release, as the previous, are due to Neil Bowers, so thanks!)
        - Using readable with special now throws an exception. Added in docs.
        - Typo in POD.

2.02    03.08.11

        generate() method. (reported by Neil Bowers, thanks!)

        ** Major change **
        - Moving to Mouse instead of Moose. Should work much faster for users
          without causing problems.

1.01    18.07.10
        - Fixed small test bug, must return from default coderef
